## Documentation (Jessica)

Jessica is at a conference so was unavailable for the meeting. 
Jessica started using Jason’s [jupyterlab demo](https://github.com/jasongrout/jupyterlab-demo) to build initial user documentation, and 
ran into installation errors with environment build (see [this issue](https://github.com/ellisonbg/jupyterlab-demo/issues/3)):

  - [Jupyterlab widgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/jupyterlab_widgets) needs release information in github
  - [Jupyterlab-geojson](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_geojson/issues/38) needs new versions released on pypi
  - Because of dependency conflicts, I can’t run the demo as in the current repo 
  - Other issues regarding ease of installation could be considered
  - Brian has moved demo to main jupyterlab repo and I have rights now
    - Brian suggests I make a new version of the demo that doesn’t include the additional jupyterlab libraries
    - Created PR to merge in Jason’s changes to Brian’s original repo
      - What’s the review process here? I just added Brian as a reviewer since I’m unfamiliar 
  - I will be using videos of demos from youtube to build high level user content in the meanwhile 


## Notebook (Grant, Thomas)

We have a request for 5.1, and it has been a couple of months since 5.0. We want to push a new release out that brings a couple of fixes (Non English Keyboard Layout) and a couple of new features. 

 
## Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks, nbviewer (Peter, Chris Holdgraff, Yuvi)

Kernel gateway 2.0 release (compatible with notebook >=5.0) [changelog](https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-2017-05-30). Kernel gateway 1.2.2 release (compatible with notebook <5.0) with [key bug fixes](https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/blob/1.2.x/CHANGELOG.md#122-2017-05-30). Lots of focus / PRs against docker-stacks to make the containers easier to use in Kubernetes and Marathon


## JupyterLab (Steve, Darian, Chris)

  [jupyterlab/jupyterlab#2380](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2380) New, File> New … open the launcher with available activities.
- Various improvements that will enhance the real time collaboration experience in the next release (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2333, https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2387). Now with indication of where the collaborators are.
- Merged initial settings system.
  [jupyterlab/jupyterlab#2157](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2157) 
- Working on a JSON schema for settings specification.
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2411

  [jupyterlab/jupyterlab#2409](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2409)
- Added a version compatibility check for extensions.
  [jupyterlab/jupyterlab#2410](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2410)
- Various style and bug fix improvements for beta.

- Released the read-only version of the data grid. Live example and feature requests issue (please up-vote your desired features!): https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor/issues/285


## JupyterHub (Min, Carol) 

Work continues on the next JupyterHub release and Kubernetes deployment of JupyterHub.


## IPython (Matthias) / Disp (Matthias,Kyle)

Nothing really noteworthy under the sun. If you are a spark user, please have a look at [disp](https://github.com/ipython/disp) it provides representation for object which do not have `_repr_*_` method. If you know of any commonly use objects that woudl benefit form it, please open issues and send PRs. 


## Other Technical Notes (plumbing packages, etc.)

Thomas would still like to work out this proposal: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/pull/261 , but is fairly busy at the moment.
