Hi Everyone,

After a couple weeks of absence, Jupyter weekly summary is back. I can't always attend the meetings and/or write summary, so if you want to give a hand the dropbox notes are public, andwe can invite you to attend the meeting if you want to polish the notes. 

Any help is welcomed !

Note: weekly news is available via the Dropbox Paper files or stored in this [news repo](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news#pulse_news).

## Project management (Fernando)

- We are aiming to complete the migration from Hackpad to dropbox paper this this week. Hackpad is closing so we need to transfer all the archives. 
- NumFocus would like a Jupyter talk at PyData Seattle July 5-7. Introduction to JupyterLab, with a demo of RTC (Ian, Chris, Brian are coordinating on this topic)
- Some questions this last week at PyCon about the migration to JupyterLab and how quickly users will be expected to adopt it. We have shared that we’re looking at at least a year or more once JLab 1.0 is released.  

## Documentation (Jessica)

We're welcomming Jessica to the team for her first week ! Jessica is our new technical writer – currently in orientation + learning
– JupyterLab tutorial in idea stage. Jessica will help us write better documentation and how to get started with Jupyter as well as more in depth Documentation, and we will looking for your contribution on these documents.

## Notebook (Grant, Thomas)

Grant will try to bundle mime renderers into classic notebook in tandem with doing the same in JupyterLab. That will give an out of the box experience that shoudl display things like GeoJson, or Vaga Lite without actions from the users. Grant will continue triaging issues, and is starting to working towards a 5.1 release. 

  
## nbconvert (M Pacer)

Nbconvert 5.2. was released a few weeks ago!
 - lots of updates to the slides exporter (esp. in the template & configurables)
 - now have a functioning scroll bar in the slides
 - A tonne of issues were closed, thanks to @damian!
 - nose has been fully removed from our testing suite 

## Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks, nbviewer (Chris, Yuvi)

- docker-stacks now work if `$HOME` is a mounted volume (waiting for tag push)
- M Pacer deployed an update to nbviewer during the dev meeting, so we are now at N > 1 people knowign how to deploy NbViewer. If you are interested in learnign how to deploy as well and giving a hand, feel free to reach out, we would be ahppy to teach you and get some help.

## JupyterLab (Steve, Darian, Chris)

- Released 0.23 last week with **provisional support for real time collaboration**.
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v0.23.0
  [ ] https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-google-drive
- Working on a refactor of launching activities in JupyterLab with a single unified experience. Feedback welcome on 
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2330
- Working through a UI/UX review for beta: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/projects/6
- The setting system feature is ready for an initial review and introduction, to be followed with some quick iterations for low-hanging fruit type features. https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/2157
- Grant and Brian will work with Chris Colbert to implement React functional/stateless component-like interface for using virtual dom: `const MyCustomButton = (props) => <button onClick={props.handleClick}>{props.label}</button>`. These components will be compiled against React and Phosphor.
- Grant will work with Steve to bundle the mime renderers (JSON, GeoJSON?, Vega/Vega-lite, Plotly) into JupyterLab
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2354

## nbformat (Brian)

- We are working to formalize the metadata for hiding input/output:
  - https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/pull/94
  We know this has been requested a lot, and that many extensions are provising that. We'd welcome your feedback and eyes on this one as well as prepare extensions to also uinderstand the standardized format. One this is Standardized, we'll need help in implmenting the support in various fromtends (JupyterLab as well as classic notebook, nbconvert, nbviewer, nteract, ... )
- Brian, Mike and Cal Poly students will begin a project to formalize “Jupyter Markdown,” which, for now, will just be the currently supported Markdown syntax in the classic notebook.

## JupyterHub (Min, Carol)

- Lots of work on Kubernetes deployment and docs during PyCon and team meetings: https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Working toward finishing new features for 0.8:
  - multiple servers per user (still quite a bit of work to do)
  - using OAuth internally (~done)
  - support alternate proxy implementations (API done, want Kubernetes ingress example as test case)

## IPython (Matthias)

The releases of IPython 5.4 and 6.1 went great. Matthias will look at some of the download statistics and will likely collaborate with M to get that for all Jupyter projects. 
- Matthias is working on having call signature in IPython / IPython kernel. that should add some extra field to the `_jupyter_experimental_typing` (still private experimental API use at your own risk). Need to discuss the name of the extra field. https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/pull/249/files right now it’s called “signature”, but I’d like to think of other language, and maybe have a more generic name (like `extra_right`) 
- “Inline” rendering in the terminal, or more specifically, mimetype handler on terminal side, register function/subprocess to handle mimetypes (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10610) , Lab/Nteract folks working on/with Electron/Electrino, can we have a standalone “mimetype” viewer ? (AKA Kyle’s Sidecar) "Viewer" is also not a great name, as this could potentially allow to also play MP3/WAV souds in teh terminal. 
  - Brian says that one way of handling this would be to enable the notebook server to connect to “foreign” kernels and then any rich frontend could show those outputs. But that is different than actual images inline. But that woudl work only for Jupyter-Console. Pure terminal IPython does nto make use of the kernel protocol, so we still need a different hook. 


- Heads up : APFS may apparently break things, watch out if there are any Unicode Filename related issues in the next couple of month on MacOS. 
  - We'll attempt to [add the filesytem to IPython's sys_info](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/10642).
  - If you are already on APFS we'll appreciate if you can try to look for bugs. 
  

## Other (plumbing packages, etc.)

- people are asking for a traitlets 5.0 release, but there are still lots of issues to resolve. The balance of progress vs stability continues to be very difficult on this repo.
