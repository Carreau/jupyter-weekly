# Jupyter Dev Meeting, 2017, Week 9 summary

Hi Everyone,

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have each
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality of
the notes taken.

There was no summary last week, so no week 8, as I got stuck because of weather.
Sorry about that. As usual any help welcome. I also try to keep writing this
summary under 30 min.

With S3 outage, I had difficulty getting the notes in a markdown format so
edition of notes will be likely really lite this week. 

# Weekly news by organization

We're experimenting with weekly auto generation of statistics. 

- [IPython](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_28_ipython.md) (in progress)
- [Jupyter](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_28_jupyter.md) (in progress)
- [JupyterLab](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_28_jupyterlab.md)
- [Jupyter-widgets](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_28_jupyter-widgets.md)
- [JupyterHub](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_28_jhub.md)

Carol still run these by hand, any help would be welcome to streamline this using travis-ci crons. 

# Project management

- We’ll use Dropbox paper for another month
- Project management tools team tutorial held last Friday, February 24. I will
  post the video and summary to the mailing list after finishing the annual
  report due Weds.
- Attended the [*Hacking at time-bound
  events*](https://hackathon-workshop.github.io/) workshop at **CSCW** in
  Portland this last Saturday, February 25 (http://cscw.acm.org/2017 -
  Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing). Next step is to
  share workshop outcomes with @Safia & @Kyle K in preparation for JupyterCon
  sprints.
- **Binder** sustainability work is moving forward. Next discussion is early
  next week.
- **I’ll be at UC Davis next Wednesday morning** to observe Tracy Teal’s launch
  of the Publishing and Sharing lessons from the Data Carpentry Reproducible
  Research Curriculum.
- Giving a **Jupyter overview talk** for the Association for Women in Science
  (AWIS) next Wednesday night in SF.
- Min and Carol are visiting UC Berkeley next week
- Ryan Lovett will try to record the **accessibility workshop next Monday, March
  6**. So far, Pete, Min, Mike, Darian, Ian, Matthias, and Yuvi are attending.


# IPython

We are closing in on 6.0 (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/33) less
than 25 open issues/PR. Help and feedback welcome. If there are any issue that
you care about not targetted fro 6.0 let us know. 

There’s some work ongoing on automating release steps
(https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/10342), to reduce the amount of time
we need to spend making releases. Hopefully this will generalize to other
projects.

Meeseeksdev infer branch to backport to (based on milestone). Just need to do
`@meeseeksdev backport` now. 5 more seconds gained to backport PRs !

We are attending a Docathon next week, we'll focus on writing more docs for
IPython and Jupyter. Feel free to join us to help and contribute ! See the
docathon website:  https://bids.github.io/docathon/
  
Some Ideas:
- Cross-link more function/class/module names in docs with sphinx’s :any: role
- Make config options individually linkable with a custom role (see what we do
  for magics as an example)
- Document JSON config: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/issues/242

# Notebook (Grant, Thomas, Jason)

Closing in on 5.0 (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/milestone/5) - 4 open
issues remaining. We’ll hopefully have RC1 or beta2 in the next couple of days.

Improving UI for move files dialog: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2234

# nbconvert (Mike)
 
-  Wrestling with fonts, encodings, LaTeX, Unicode coverage and Travis (see
[issue 533](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/533) and [pr
537](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/537))

  - The solution may be to just have a more directly controllable server on
    which we test using a custom build (rather than trying to convince travis to
    behave nicely).
  - If anyone has particularly strong feelings about fonts/typography, the
    solution is likely to involve changing the default export fonts, so you may
    want to keep an eye on that issue and pr.
  - I’m going to be thinking about how to move to a more configurable setup for
    people to customise


# Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks (Pete)

nbviewer has been having issues hitting the GitHub API rate limit recently.
After some investigation, a few SEO bots have been identified as the primary
cause, and action taken:


1. block two ips driving a huge amount of traffic (in fastly)
2. update robots.txt to slow down respectful bots
3. dramatically increase caching of upstream requests, so that cached responses
   can be used more often https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/pull/674
4. allow using cached responses even if upstream requests fail because a stale
   render is better than an error https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/pull/674
5. implement our own rate limiting in nbviewer, to prevent future exhaustion
   from a small number of sources https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/pull/675

The result is that the current situation is much better, when it comes to high
traffic:

- the direct source of the traffic is blocked
- consumption of the GitHub API is greatly reduced under normal circumstances
- behavior when the API rate limit is exceeded is greatly improved
- considerate bots (that respect robots.txt) should not cause the problem again
- inconsiderate bots (or humans) are rate limited, making it a little harder to
  cause the problem again

I (Min) set up a loggly account to do the log digging. I can invite anyone
interested to get access to the account. I’ve drafted a blogpost it, and
submitted it to the newsletter.


# Dashboard and related extensions** (Pete)
No Pete today


# JupyterLab (Steve, Darian)

We’re working toward a release since the port over to the new version of
PhosphorJS. We have been trying to finish up a set of beta bug fixes before that
release.


# ipywidgets (Jason**, Sylvain)  (+ Brian, Cameron)
  
ipywidgets 6.0 should be released today.


# JupyterHub (Min, Carol)

It’s been a fairly quiet week for JupyterHub with the bulk of the work being
done on issues, questions, and triage. Both Min and Carol will be at Berkeley
next week.

# Conferences/Outreach

New:

- One week remaining to submit talk to JupyterCon
- Please keep drumming up interest in your networks!

Already Announced:

- Speaker outreach for [JupyterCon](http://jupytercon.com) has begun. Please
  share that the Call For Proposal is open with your personal networks. We
  encourage anyone who is considering submitting a talk to do so. **Yes, core
  devs can submit a talk!!** Please contact us with any questions.
- Call For Proposals for SciPy opened last week, registration opens Feb. 27
- PyData Amsterdam: 8-9 April, Call For Proposals is due 5 March
  http://pydata.org/amsterdam2017/

# Action Items for this week

- Does anyone have expertise in the intersection of LaTeX (spec. \fontspec) +
  default LaTeX fonts + Unicode coverage + font formats (+ Travis) especially in
  a cross-platform context? If so, please contact Mike.
- Mike is to contact Min when visiting re: Randy and other custom publishing
  workflows at Simula. (should not need to be copied to next week)
- Fernando - Carol is requesting demo notes to share with PyData Ann Arbor on
  Thursday night.
- Ping your networks to have people submit talks for JupyterCon! Email your
  friends directly as it’s most effective.


# Releases this week:

- JupyterLab 0.17
- nbdime-0.3
- ipywidgets 6.0 in the next hours
- notebook 5.0 beta2 (or rc1)

# Releases soon:

- IPython 6.0 is on its way. Probably mid march for a beta, maybe before.

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Any help to put this document in form
before sending it to the mailing list is welcome. It's a collaborative document
so anyone can pitch in.

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections like sections too long,
to short missing informations, your input is welcomed. We'll keep these summary
for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.

Matthias
