# Jupyter Dev Meeting, 2017, Week 10 summary

Hi Everyone,

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have each
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality of
the notes taken.

## Project management (Jamie)

- JupyterCon CFP deadline extended to March 14 - looking for additional Data
  Science and AI submissions
- Fernando submitted the foundation report last Weds - great teamwork at
  Berkeley finishing the report
- Participated in JupyterCon speaker office hours on Saturday- good questions
  and topic proposals posted
- Binder planning session occurred on Sunday- incubator showcase is still down-
  [ML thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jupyter/-oDxcftZK7Q)
- Visiting UC Davis tomorrow morning for Reproducible Research in Jupyter lesson
  on publishing and sharing
- Working this week with Min & Carol on release schedule/history and other
  metrics (time permitting)

## IPython

There are some disagreements on a bringing backs hooks for the readline
interface (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/10364). We would would like
people to read and pitch in if they have the use (or not).


The IPython team is participating in the
[Docathon](http://bids.github.io/docathon/) and we are writing docs !


Matthias is working on Async/Await in the REPL (just exploring simplifying
workflow), allowing bare `await` at the top level in the REPL.

## Notebook (Grant, Thomas, Jason) (+ Mike)

- We are still testing 5.0.0b1
- I (Grant) will get the outstanding 5.0 PRs merged today and release 5.0.0b1
- PRs with 5.0 milestone
  - [~~#2249~~](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2249)~~: Test the cell
    tags toolbar~~ 
  - [#2234](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2234): [WIP] Show server
    root directory in move dialog
- Latex https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2220, implemented and tested in
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1846
- Testing in casper and the notebook 

  
## nbconvert (Mike)

 -  decent amount of progress on unicode coverage locally 
     - have more or less given up on fixing it on travis
 - generating json for traitlets & nbconvert as a service
     - discussion after last week about generating a jsonschema for
       automatically generating UI for configurable parameters

## Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks (Pete, Min)

- Thanks @Min R for fixing the session deserialize problem when switching to
  notebook 5.0 https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/228.
- There’s a PR out to remove the KG specific activity tracking API in favor of
  the one in notebook 5.0 (https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/230).
  It’ll be a breaking API change, and so the next KG release will be 2.0.
  (Another one of the session deserialization bugs popped up in the PR test run.
  It could be that I undid part of Min’s fix. I’ll look into it.)
- I started looking at making KG token auth match the scheme used in notebook.
  KG can’t reuse the code per se because it still relies on cookies after the
  one-time token is authenticated. However, I think KG can support the token in
  the URL query string and on websocket connections like notebook.

## Dashboard and related extensions (Pete)

- There are PRs waiting on jupyter/dashboards,
  jupyter-incubator/dashboard_bundlers, and jupyter-incubator/contentmanagement
  making them all Notebook 5.0 compatible. I’ll merge the PRs after 5.0 final
  release and make new releases of each.
- From mailing list: jupyter-incubator/showcase is not working (and probably
  hasn’t been for some time). See if it’s worth resurrecting else point folks to
  the doc about how to install locally.

## JupyterLab (Steve, Darian, Chris)

- Released 0.17 with enhancements to the Command Palette and RenderMime, and 

      numerous bug fixes.
      https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v0.17.0

- Successfully implemented Lerna[1] for mono-repo management in Phosphor,
  preparing for JupyterLab next.  JupyterLab will become a single repository
  with independently versioned packages, that are all symbolic-linked when
  working on JupyterLab itself. This will make consuming JupyterLab easier for
  extension authors and for third party use.
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1773

- Updated the `HoverBox` functionality to accept more options for how completers
  and tooltips render, added the ability to handle arbitrarily nested hosts for
  the anchor that the hover box follows:
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1830
- Working on a “single document mode” for the dock panel. This brought up some
  issues about handling maximum sizes of widgets in layout. This is being
  tracked in this in-progress PR:
  https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor/pull/233

https://lernajs.io/

## ipywidgets (Jason, Sylvain)  (+ Brian, Cameron)

We released ipywidgets 6.0, and have been following up on feedback from the
community. Things seem to be going fairly well, and feedback from the community
is pointing to some high priority items to work on next (like an OutputWidget in
the web context, https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/issues/986).

- We have released jupyter-sphinx 0.1.0

We have released a bunch of downstream packages (pythreejs, ipyleaflet, ipympl)
following the 6.0 release. Also, we’d like to especially call out a nice package
from Maarten Breddels: ipyvolume (https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
with live widgets in the documentation, including a VR view
(https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vr.html). We’re working on migrating
widgets to the newest phosphor packages and updating the widgets to work in the
most recent JupyterLab (https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/pull/1122).

## JupyterHub (Min, Carol) 

Lots of productive discussion happening during our Berkeley visit this week!

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Any help to put this document in form
before sending it to the mailing list is welcome. It's a collaborative document
so anyone can pitch in.

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections like sections too long,
to short missing informations, your input is welcomed. We'll keep these summary
for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.

Matthias
