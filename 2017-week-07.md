# Jupyter Dev Meeting, 2017, Week 7 summary

Hi Everyone,

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have each
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality of
the notes taken.

Any help welcome. I also try to keep writing this summary under 30 min.

## Notebook (Grant, Thomas, Jason)

The notebook team released notebook 4.4.1 last week which is now available both
on PyPI and conda forge. There is one more small change to fix a frustration
with widgets (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2174), but we’re waiting
until we make sure that there are no other notebook changes for ipywidgets 6.

We are a few issues/PRs away from 5.0 release:

  - [issues remaining  for 5.0](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A5.0) 
  - Track the last remaining steps (non issues)
    [here](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2150) help is welcome.

We hope to put beta 1 out today after the meeting

Please pitch in if you need anything else before we start the beta/rc cycle !



## JupyterLab (Steve, Darian)

Steve started a major refactor of rendermime → output area → cell → notebook to
utilize the Ian’s ObservableMap.  This is resulting in a lot cleaner code base,
and gives the rendermime renderers a live data model with mime data and metadata
.  Thanks, Ian!
  - ObservableMap: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1707
  - Refactor: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1709

Darian is working on a overhaul of tooltip, completion, and inspector plugins to
follow the same pattern of a third party author adding substantial content to
notebooks and consoles.
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1631

The cell metadata editor now uses a code editor, released in 0.16.  There was a
rendering bug that forced a 0.16.2 release this morning which also includes some
style improvements.

There’s a discussion about future support for dashboards in JupyterLab in
https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1640.


## ipywidgets (Jason, Sylvain)

We’ve been making continual progress towards a 6.x public beta. We closed 12
issues, merged 16 PRs, and we’re down to 13 open issues for 6.0.

Jason is wondering if Carol’s pulse news activity report in the JupyterHub
section is automated. Something like that would be great to have as part of this
report to the mailing list.


## JupyterHub (Min, Carol)

- The team triaged and closed 24 open issues in JupyterHub.
- Here’s the activity report for the past week for [JupyterHub
  projects](https://github.com/willingc/pulse_news/blob/master/2017_02_14_jhub.md).
- Berkeley Data 8 had their first incident with the current deployment and have
  posted a great [post
  mortem](https://github.com/data-8/infrastructure/blob/master/incidents/2017-02-09-datahub-db-outage.md)
  prompting fixes for JupyterHub and other repos.

## Nbconvert (Mike)

Thomas has restarted work on overriding the default script export for specific
programming languages, using a new group of entry points:
https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/531

Renewed Interest for a JATS/XML exporter, discussion will be respawned in March
once some folks are visiting Berkeley.

## Binder

We discussed how to pick up binder from Jeremy and Andrew as Jeremy has left
Janelia Lab. With them,  Chris Holdgraf and the Data8 people, we discussed what
can be done in the short (infrastructure should not be funded anymore in 4 to 6
month) and long term for the sustainability of binder, and how to merge with
JupyterHub. A further longer summary will be poster by Jamie later.

There was a strong interest in various forms of federated design.

There was also some discussion of Binder & related services at the recent
OpenDreamKit meeting. There may be people in Europe with time to work on it, and
*maybe* even computational resources to support it (this is a fairly distant
possibility, at this point).

## Conferences/Outreach

- PyCon US 2017: Congrats to the tutorials, talks, poster, and education summit
  talks acceptances.
  - We’ll have a Jupyter Tutorial.
- Speaker outreach for [JupyterCon](http://jupytercon.com) has begun. Please
  share that the Call For Proposal is open with your personal networks. We
  encourage anyone who is considering submitting a talk to do so. Please contact
  us with any questions.
- Call For Proposal for SciPy opened last week, registration opens Feb. 27
- PyData Amsterdam: 8-9 April, Call For Proposal is due 5 March
  http://pydata.org/amsterdam2017/
- PyData London: 5-7 May, CFP due 24 February http://pydata.org/london2017/


## Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks (Pete)

- Jupyter Kernel Gateway 1.2.0 is now available on PyPI. The conda-forge package
  is pending Travis build
  (https://github.com/conda-forge/jupyter_kernel_gateway-feedstock/pull/3)
  Thanks, everyone, for the PR reviews. I’ll post a release announcement to the
  list soon.
- I (Peter) / we need to start looking at kernel gateway compatibility with
  notebook master in prep for notebook 5.0 release.

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Any help to put this document in form
before sending it to the mailing list is welcome. It's a collaborative document
so anyone can pitch in.

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections like sections too long,
to short missing informations, your input is welcomed. We'll keep these summary
for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.
