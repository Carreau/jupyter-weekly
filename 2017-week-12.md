Hi Everyone,

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have each
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality of
the notes taken.

I'm not available next week, so Carol should take over (Thanks to her, she is
already doing a lot !). A Small reminder to try to make sentences, I had to
remove a couple of sections that feel like bullet points with words a which
don't make sens without context. As I take only 30 minutes to write this
summary, I can't take the time to rephrase things for you.

Apologies again for forgetting last week summary and posting it earlier today.

Also I'm _trying_ to publish these as nice formatted documents, but it appears
like Google groups is delivering these s raw text sometime. Appologies for that
as well, if any of you has a better solution (I use MarkdownHere), I'm all ears.

# Project management (Jamie)

- This week: follow-up on last week’s Reproducible Science workshop.
- Starting preparations for the Spring 2017 team meeting in Berkeley
- Quick question, do we need a governance section?
  - There are 2 PRs I think are ready for merge, anyone wants more time to look at them?:
    - https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/27
    - https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/22

# Notebook (Grant, Thomas, Jason)

Some users were encountering an install issue related to our npm dependencies
(preact, preact-compat, proptypes). Grant moved these dependencies to bower so
that the notebook no longer depends on any npm dependencies (except dev
dependencies). Hopefully to resolves
[#2056](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2056).

We will publish one more release candidate (rc2) to test the above issue and
give the community and little more time to test other features before general
release.

# nbconvert (Mike)

I’m working on a simple filter mechanism for all killing inputs, outputs, input
prompts, output prompts, markdown, or code cells with a simple traitlet
interface.

This should be much more straightforward than tag based filtering, I’m pursuing
that independently.

I’m working on the js side of uploading configuration from within the browser.

# Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks (Min, can’t make it today)

- [JupyterLab 0.17 has been added to the minimal-notebook docker stack](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/pull/355).

# Dashboard and related extensions (Pete)

Peter will do some final sanity testing of the updated extensions again notebook
5.0.0rc1. When notebook 5.0 final is out, we can cut releases of the various
extensions.

# JupyterLab (Steve, Darian, Chris)

JupyterLab Released 0.18 Tuesday morning.
  - Split the repository into multiple packages that are managed using the lerna
    build tool. https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1773
  - Added restoration of main area layout on refresh.
    https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1880
  - Numerous bug fixes and style updates.
- Cleaning up the developer workflow in light of 50+ packages:
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1962
- Ongoing discussion about observable lists and maps as they relate to real time
  collaboration.
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1959
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1961
- Universal context menus have been added and should already be available for
  use.

# ipywidgets (Jason, Sylvain)  (+ Brian, Cameron)

We merged a PR from Maarten Breddels to allow us to have binary data synced back
and forth much more easily (https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/pull/1194).
Congratulations on Maarten’s first contribution to widgets!

We’ve been concentrating on documenting the widget protocol and model
attributes. We have a specification for the widget messaging protocol up at
https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/blob/master/jupyter-widgets-schema/messages.md,
and a draft of a model spec at https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/pull/1207.
This exposed some code smell in the protocol which we are beginning to clean up
for ipywidgets 7 - if you have any suggestions for changing the widgets
protocol, please let us know. Related to this, we have a PR for removing the
frontend version check from the protocol (which is causing needless frustration)
at https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets/pull/1219.

We also upgraded to the latest stack of phosphor packages, which is an important
step in being compatible with JupyterLab 0.18.

We will also be moving to the new jupyter-widgets github org this next week.

# JupyterHub (Min, Carol) 

Min is traveling this week. Carol and Yuvi are working on documenting how to set
up JupyterHub using Kubernetes based on Data8 deployment.

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Any help to put this document in form
before sending it to the mailing list is welcome. It's a collaborative document
so anyone can pitch in.

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections like sections too long,
to short missing informations, your input is welcomed. We'll keep these summary
for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.
