# Jupyter Dev Meeting, 2017, Week 5 summary

Hi Everyone,

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have each
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality
of the notes taken.

Any help welcome. I also try to keep writing this summary under 30 min.

# Project management

- Next week we'll try Dropbox paper
- Project Mgt Team Tutorial Doodle poll - check your e-mail later today

# Notebook

Damian informs us that the next Anaconda release will not ship the set of
extensions we were including by default (`nb_conda_kernels`, `nb_conda`,
etc...). Still available at defaults channel but it will. This will allow to
have the same experience from default notebook install and anaconda install.
This should lead to less confusions. This is the v4.3 release, which is
scheduled for January 31st.

A fix for CodeMirror to have things both working on Safari 10, and with Python
3.6 f-Strings has been added on notebook 4.3. It requires a custom patch for
CodeMirror which we tend to not like as it makes things more complicated for
downstream packagers. We hope a fix in CodeMirror soon.

Grant is seeing a bunch of error when running tests locally when JupyterLab is
installed. He is wondering if anyone have seen this. Carol has not seen such an
issue.

The Notebook 4.3.2 release is expected today and being tracked here:

# JupyterLab

The Jupyterlab team will be releasing 0.15 this afternoon. This new version of
JupyterLab adds the ability to open links as widgets within JupyterLab - a link
to a notebook in an output area opens the notebook in the dock panel
[(jupyterlab/1565)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1565),  and it
also changes the way configuration is handled - to better interact with Jupyter
Notebook configuration. cf
[(jupyterlab/1555)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1555)

The team is continuing to work on refactoring, testing, and hardening for
the beta release, and targeting beta issues.

The team is working on a cell metadata side panel area
[(jupyterlab/1586)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1586)

There have been some usability fixes to the new toolbar widget, some bugfixes
in the completer + hardened tests to try to prevent regressions in the future

Request for Comments about partial partial rendering, please look ad respond
the following issue: on this issue:
[(jupyterlab/1587)](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1587)



# JupyterHub

JupyterHub Team Tutorial went well on Friday. Video has not been posted yet it
needs some post processing, but should be available soon. Work is ongoing on
multiple servers per user and HubShare.



# nbconvert

There are a few PRs for making a configurable filter that allows customizing
the anchor link text (currently ¶), which will also allow having no visible
anchor. They take different approaches that hint at a stylistic discussion.

One of the PRs makes the filter itself configurable using Traitlets (which
means the anchor text will be export format independent). This requires making
more things into classes so they can inherit Traitlets configuration.

- https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/520

Two of them add a Traitlet to the html exporter:

- https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/508
- https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/522

It is unsure which approach we want to go with. Feedback from users of convert
would help to understand which solution would be the simplest and the most
useful.

Thomas and Mike came up with an approach to solving the other anchor id problem. 


# IPython

Matthias released IPython 5.2.0 on Sunday, Thomas released 5.2.1
yesterday/today (depending on timezone), please upgrade :-) 

Matthias is still waiting for reviews on
[10182](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10182) (Jedi integration, first pass). I
don't want to grow the PR beyond 800ish lines. 


# Conferences/Outreach

- PyData Amsterdam: http://pydata.org/amsterdam2017/ 8-9 April

- PyData London: http://pydata.org/london2017/ 5-7 May, Call For Proposal deadline 24 Feb

- We'll be at PyCon Portland (May 17-25) – no Jupyter Talk (from us at least),
  Maybe a tutorial (not sure yet). 

# Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks

There's one PR in progress to update an example notebook in kernel gateway.
Then I'd like to cut a release adding HTTPS, fixing some multilanguage bugs,
etc. (Changelog updates forthcoming.)

# Xeus 

Xeus is c++ implementation of Jupyter protocol, By Sylvain Corlay and Johan
Mabille. It should simplify writing kernel for languages having C/C++ bindings.
Request for feedback!

# How can I help/Get involved

Grant is having some issues with Notebook tests conflicting with JupyterLab,
can you reproduce them or not ?
- https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2101

Matthias could use some review of his Jedi integration PR:
- https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10182

If you want to weigh in on heuristics for partial rendering of notebooks for
performance improvements:

# Releases this week

- JupyterLab 0.15
- IPython 5.2.1
- Notebook 4.3.2

# Openness, Diversity and Dignity

The current situation in the US is affecting our work, we would appreciate if
you could read how it is affecting us and will affect us in the next few month.

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Making these summary is becoming
easier. Some sections are still hard to work with.

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections, your input is welcomed.
We'll keep these summary for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.
