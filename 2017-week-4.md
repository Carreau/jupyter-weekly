Hi Everyone, 

This is my attempt at writing a weekly summary of our video meeting we have on
Tuesday. I'm using the notes that have been taken during the meeting by the
collective effort so the quality of the section depends highly on the quality
of the notes taken.

Any help welcome. I also try to keep writing this summary under 30min. 

# Project Management

We have a JupyterHub Tutorial this Friday (January 27) in order to the team get
up to speed with JupyterHub, we'll send an agenda , but the meeting will be
recorded. 

Someone started adding new releases to the new [release
log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16fpjrU2W2YBWUFrFFyY3N5IxNZRykuoZhKkRJE_ulYk/edit#gid=0)
until we implement a way to automate adding to the list. We are currently looking at
ways to pull historic release data using the GitHub API you can follow the work
here: https://github.com/jupyter/project-mgt/issues/25 

We've been trying etherpad and will keep using it until next week. We'll start
using DropBox Paper next month (make sure you have a dropbox account by then if
you want to write notes). We'll try various project for a month, Etherpad was
the first.

# Notebook 

The notebook team added activity watching for kernels on the server side.  This
will be used in JupyterHub and JupyterLab for kernel session managment.
https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1827 This allow to know when the
kernel was last alive and can be use for cleanup stalled kernel as extension.
Currently going through issues to try to get 5.0 out as soon as possible.
Hopefully Beta next month.

# JupyterLab

The jupyter lab team have released v0.13 with improvements to State Restoration
on page refresh. It improves robustness and adds handling of side bar state.

They Finished refactor that allows notebooks and consoles to be more easily
customized both in widgets and models. See :

  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1482
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1509

Cells and OutputArea are now top level directories in the source tree, in
preparation for making them separate npm packages:

  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1536

The team has also been working on tooltip implementation that will allow
tooltips to be summoned using a customizable keyboard shortcut.
  
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1519

Version info (of JupyterLab ? I guess) has been to the about page
  - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/1518

They are currently pushing hard on refactoring and bug fixes toward the beta
release.


# IPywidgets (Jason, Sylvain)

The IPywidget team is continuing to  work on polishing ipywidgets 6.x. Major
things merged include temporarily reverting the dropdown back to a native
select box - the plan is to abstract out the dropdown control as a phosphor
control and wrap it. We also are continuing to test against complicated widget
examples and fixing/polishing things.


# JupyterHub (Min, Carol)

We're looking forward to sharing info about JupyterHub with the team on Friday.
(cf future announcement)

An overview of JupyterHub's development activity is [here](https://github.com/willingc/org-pulse/blob/jhub/2017_01_24_jhub.md): 

- Christian Barra is getting into JupyterHub by implementing pieces of multiple
  servers per user.
- Carol is working on improving the test suite.
- Min is exploring the possibility of JupyterHub as an OAuth *provider*, which
  would make integrating services easier, and avoid the cookie path isolation
  that causes headaches now.
- Hope to have a skeleton of HubShare in place this week, so we can get started
  implementing the spec.

# nbconvert (Mike) 

Mike released nbconvert 5.1.1 (We had to skip the 5.1.0 release) 

Lot of work have been put on automation for releases:
 - building up a few scripts to handling virtual envs, testing sdists
   (source distribution) and bdists ("binary" distribution , aka wheels) on
   python2 and 3 (docs also build, with caveats)

NbConvert 5.0.0 and 5.1.1 are now on conda forge (many thanks min, thomas & jakirkham)
- https://github.com/conda-forge/nbconvert-feedstock/pull/7
- https://github.com/conda-forge/nbconvert-feedstock/pull/10

# IPython

Matthias has been working on a major update of the IPython completer using Jedi
now capable of a lot more than before and should address many of the current
issues open on tab completion:

- https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10182

The Pull request is quasi complete (including test, docs, backward
compatibility... etc) but would need a couple of testers and feedback on new
API. 

# Conferences/Outreach

## PyCon 2017

Our PyCon 2017 Talk (Matthias Mike Thomas Min) was accepted on
transitioning from Python 2 to 3 was accepted! You can read the proposal
[here](https://github.com/python3statement/pycon-2017/blob/master/proposal.md)

We are looking forward to see you there. we are still waiting to know if the
Jupyter Tutorial was accepted. 

## Computational Mathematics with Jupyter

http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/

Sylvain attended, and reports that there are a number of initiatives in the
Sage community interesting to us, such as new kernels for Singular and Gap.

## DataDrivenNYC meetup

https://www.meetup.com/DataDrivenNYC/events/236144257/

Sylvain and Jason are giving a 15-minute talk on Jupyter.


# Services - kernel gateway, docker-stacks (Pete)

Addressing a handful of outstanding kernel gateway bugs / feature requests (SSL
support, better tutorial, kernel shutdown regression) and then will cut a 1.2
release. Pete appreciate reviews of the 3-4 PRs if anyone has time:
    
- https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/milestone/9 
    
The jupyter/pyspark-notebook and jupyter/all-spark-notebook images in docker-stacks
moved to Spark 2.0.2 in the recent past. (Should move to Spark 2.1 soon too!)
The spylon-kernel package was added to all-spark-notebook, new metakernel based
Scala kernel and/or ipython magic that can execute Scala code in a notebook:

- https://github.com/mariusvniekerk/spylon-kernel

# How can you help:

Peter needs help reviewing a few PRs:

- https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/217
- https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/216
- https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/215
- https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway/pull/214


# See you next week !

Thanks you for reading, and thanks a lot for those of you who wrote sections
with full sentences and all the details. Making these summary is becoming
easier. 

As usual if you have any questions/feedback/corrections, your input is welcomed.
We'll keep these summary for a couple of weeks to see if you find them useful.

Thanks.
